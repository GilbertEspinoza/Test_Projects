# Test_Projects


Hi! This is my repository of testing projects. Here you will find projects about software 
testing and QA (Quality Assurance). My first projects were in Spanish, but I plan to expand 
this repository to include more testing projects and versions in other languages like Portuguese and English later on.

# 0_ProyectBugPracticeReport: This project is the first bug report model that I made that describes the problems identified
during software testing. test training website "https://demo.guru99.com/test/newtours/" was used for this purpose. 
The data collected to make the template were: ID, Title, criticality, environment, type of defect, operating system,
description, preconditions, steps to follow, expected result, actual result and evidence.

# 1_TestingAndDocmentation:  Test cases were created in this project to ensure the quality of the software of a frequently 
used site such as the web page of the university where I study: "https://campus.fch.unicen.edu.ar/". More detailed information 
is given on the tests performed on different sections of the web page, with the expected results, the results obtained and the corresponding evidence.

# 2_ApiTesting: This project aimed to apply and implement the different API Testing methods, such as GET, PUT, DELETE and POST.
In addition to testing endpoint calls, response codes and protocols used for communication between client-server applications.
In this project, a set of API tests were performed using: the free "PokemonAPI" API and the "Postman" tool.

# 3_FinalProyect_TestCase: For this project I selected a website of a national clothing brand in Argentina called Mauro Sergio, 
here the URL https://mayorista.maurosergio.com/. The idea was to provide a more detailed description of specific tests performed.
Describing the steps to be followed, the inputs to be provided, the preconditions to be established and the expected results. 
Gather sufficient data on each test performed, as well as its priority and evidence.

# 3_FinalProyect_TestReport: This section contains the test report of the final project, where the results of the tests made to the website of the clothing brand https://mayorista.maurosergio.com/ were recorded.
The problems encountered, errors identified, their type and criticality are summarized.

# 4_Pruebas+automaticas+BuggyCars.side: This is a small project to practice my skills in Selenium IDE, for this we took a well known tester site, https://buggy.justtestit.org/ Buggycars, and performed tests such as: Registering a new user, home page, validating the voting system, etc.

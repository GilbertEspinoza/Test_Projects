# Test_Projects


Hello! this is my repository of testing projects. Here you will find projects about software 
testing and QA (Quality Assurance). My first projects were in Spanish, but I plan to expand 
this repository to include versions in other languages like Portuguese and English later on.

# 0_ProyectBugPracticeReport: This project is the first bug report model that I made that describes the problems identified
during software testing. The testing website https://demo.guru99.com/test/newtours/ was used for this purpose. 

The data collected to make the template were: ID, Title, criticality, environment, type of defect, operating system,
description, preconditions, steps to follow, expected result, actual result and evidence.


# 1_TestingAndDocmentation: In this project we tested the documentation in testing with the creation of test cases 
to ensure the quality of the software of a frequently used site such as the web page of the university where I
study: "https://campus.fch.unicen.edu.ar/". more detailed information is given on the tests performed on different 
sections of the web page, with the expected results, the results obtained and the corresponding evidence.

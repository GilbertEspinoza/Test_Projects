# Test_Projects


Hello! this is my repository of testing projects. Here you will find projects about software 
testing and QA (Quality Assurance). My first projects were in Spanish, but I plan to expand 
this repository to include versions in other languages like Portuguese and English later on.

# 0_ProyectBugPracticeReport: This project is the first bug report model that I made that describes the problems identified
during software testing. The testing website https://demo.guru99.com/test/newtours/ was used for this purpose. 

The data collected to make the template were: ID, Title, criticality, environment, type of defect, operating system,
description, preconditions, steps to follow, expected result, actual result and evidence.
